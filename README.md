# Solidity and Decentralized App Development

This repository is a starting point for learning Solidity and developing decentralized applications (DApps).

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Basic understanding of blockchain and smart contracts

## Setup Instructions
```
npm install surya truffle solc ganache mocha chai @openzeppelin/contracts hardhat lite-server --save-dev
```
1. **Install Truffle**: Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum.
2. **Install Solidity Compiler (solc)**:
3. **Install Ganache**: Ganache provides a personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
4. **Install Testing Frameworks (Mocha and Chai)**:
5. **Install OpenZeppelin Contracts**:
6. **Install Hardhat (optional)**: Hardhat is another Ethereum development environment.
7. **Install lite-server (For DApp Frontend Development)**:
8. **Initialize Truffle Project**:
9. **Compile Contracts**:
10. **Running Ganache**:
 - Download and run the Ganache application.
11. **Migrate Contracts**:

```
 truffle compile && truffle migrate
```
12. **Testing Contracts**:
 - Create test files in the `test` directory.
 - Run tests using:
```
truffle test
```

## Creating Your First Contract and Migration
- Create your Solidity contract in the `contracts` directory.
- Create a migration script in the `migrations` directory.
- Compile and migrate your contract as shown in steps 9 and 11.

## Next Steps
- Explore creating decentralized applications using the setup provided.
- Extend your learning with frontend technologies to interact with your smart contracts.

Happy Coding!
